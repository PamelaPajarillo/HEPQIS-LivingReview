Wu:2020cye,"'Signal-Background Discrimination'","'Variational Quantum Circuits'","Signal-background discrimination, where signal events are $t\bar{t}H$ ($H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$) and $H\rightarrow\mu\mu$, and background events are dominant Standard Model processes","Variational quantum circuits","With 100 training events, 100 test events, and 10 encoded variables, the AUC of IBM's quantum computer simulator that includes a noise model with 10 qubits are similar to the AUC of a classical support vector machine (SVM) and a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier. The results show that IBM's quantum computer and quantum simulator are in good agreement, however, the run time on the quantum computer is longer than the classical machine learning algorithms due to the limitations in quantum hardware."
Wu:2021xsj,"'Signal-Background Discrimination'","'Quantum Support Vector Machines'","Signal-background discrimination, where signal events are $t\bar{t}H$ ($H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$), and background events are dominant Standard Model processes","Support vector machine with a quantum kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel)","The performance of these quantum simulators, using 15 qubits and 60 independent datasets of 20000 training events and 20000 testing events, are similar to the performance of a classical SVM and a classical BDT. The QSVM-Kernel algorithm is then implemented on IBM's quantum processor. The mean performance of QSVM-Kernel on IBM's quantum processor and IBM's quantum computer simulator is about 5\% lower. This difference is expected due to hardware noise. The results on IBM's quantum processor does approach the performance of IBM's quantum computer simulator. The paper concludes that the running time is expected to be reduced with improved quantum hardware and predicts that quantum machine learning could potentially become a powerful tool for HEP data analyses."

Terashi:2020wfi,"'Signal-Background Discrimination'; 'Beyond the Standard Model'","'Variational Quantum Circuits'","Signal-background discrimination, where the signal is a SUSY process, in particular, a chargino-pair production via a Higgs boson, where the final state has two charged leptons and missing transverse momentum. The background event is a $W$ boson pair production $WW$ where each $W$ decays into a charged lepton and a neutrino.","Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) and Quantum Circuit Learning (QCL)","The performance of the QCL algorithms on quantum simulators is characterized by a relatively flat AUC as a function of the number of training events. The AUC for QCL is higher than the AUC for BDT and DNN for a low number of training events, however, for high training events, the performance for BDT and DNN surpasses QCL. The VQC algorithm has been tested on IBM's quantum computer, and the performance is similar to that of the quantum simulator. However, there is an increase in uncertainty due to hardware noise. Other QCL and VQC models are tested, which do not show any improvement to the nominal QCL and VQC models. The behavior that variational quantum algorithms does better with a small number of training data could be considered as a possible advantage over classical machine learning."
