Schuhmacher:2023pro,"'Anomaly Detection', 'Beyond the Standard Model'","'Quantum Support Vector Machines'","Anomaly detection, where the background is Standard Model (SM) events, and the anomaly is either the Higgs boson or the Randall-Sundrum Graviton decaying to two $Z$ bosons, where each of the $Z$ bosons decay to a lepton pair","(1) Generated a data set of artificial events that do not rely on a specific BSM theory by using SM events and varying the different features by dataset scrambling, which is done by replacing a feature with a new value chosen according to a Gaussian distribution and a scrambling factor; (2) Applied Classical and Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (CSVCs and QSVCs respectively) trained to identify the artificial anomalies to distinguish between SM and BSM events","An SVC trained to identify artificial anomalies was able to identify BSM events with high accuracy. In identifying artificial anomalies, the CSVC outperforms the QSVC, however, the difference in performance between the QSVC and the CSVC shrinks for increasing number of features, and increasing scrambling strength. In identifying Higgs and Graviton events, the QSVC performs better than the CSVC with a low scrambling factor. When the scrambling factor increases, the performance gap shrinks when detecting Graviton events, and the CSVC outperforms the QSVC when detecting the Higgs. The paper concludes that while there is no advantage of using a quantum classifier, the limitations in performance could be due to using classical features that describe quantum HEP processes."
Wozniak:2023xbe,"'Anomaly Detection'","'Quantum Support Vector Machines', 'Quantum Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms'","Anomaly detection, where the following BSM processes are considered anomalies: (1) narrow Randall-Sundrum gravitons decaying to two $W$-bosons (Narrow $G \rightarrow WW$); (2) broad Randall-Sundrum graviton decaying to two $W$-bosons (Broad $G \rightarrow WW$); (3) scalar bosons $A$ decaying to a Higgs and a $Z$ boson ($A \rightarrow HZ$)","(1) Used a convolutional autoencoder model to map events into a latent representation of reduced dimensionality; (2) A Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), the Quantum K-means (QK-means) algorithm, and the Quantum K-medians algorithm, are trained to find anomalous events in the latent representation, as well as their respective classical counterparts","With a training sample of size 600 and a fixed latent dimensionality $l = 8$, all classical and quantum ML methods performed worst on the broad Graviton and best with the narrow Graviton, which is expected since the broad Graviton is the most similar to SM processes, making it harder to identify, while the narrow Graviton is the least similar to SM processes, making it easier to identify. The unsupervised kernel machine outperforms both clustering algorithms and is the only model where the quantum classifier outperforms the classical counterpart. If entanglement is not present in the quantum feature map, the performance of the QSVM is worse or matches the performance of the CSVM. This paper demonstrates a consistent performance advantange of quantum models over classical models for a particle physics anomaly detection task, where a combination of an autoencoder with quantum anomaly detection models proved to be a viable strategy for data-driven searches for new physics.

The QSVM-Kernel algorithm is then implemented on IBM's quantum processor. The mean performance of QSVM-Kernel on IBM's quantum processor and IBM's quantum computer simulator is about 5\% lower. This difference is expected due to hardware noise. The results on IBM's quantum processor does approach the performance of IBM's quantum computer simulator. The paper concludes that the running time is expected to be reduced with improved quantum hardware and predicts that quantum machine learning could potentially become a powerful tool for HEP data analyses."

The AUC for QCL is higher than the AUC for BDT and DNN for a low number of training events, however, for high training events, the performance for BDT and DNN surpasses QCL. The VQC algorithm has been tested on IBM's quantum computer, and the performance is similar to that of the quantum simulator. However, there is an increase in uncertainty due to hardware noise. Other QCL and VQC models are tested, which do not show any improvement to the nominal QCL and VQC models. The behavior that variational quantum algorithms does better with a small number of training data could be considered as a possible advantage over classical machine learning."
