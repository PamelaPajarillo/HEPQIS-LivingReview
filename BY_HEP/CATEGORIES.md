## **Anomaly Detection** [![Papers-anomaly-detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#anomaly-detection-)
One of the main goals of high energy physics is to search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. The most common strategy in BSM searches is to pick a specific BSM signal model and estimate the background from Standard Model (SM) processes. The signal events are then combined with the background events to develop an analysis strategy to be appled on real data. This strategy is strongly model-dependent.

## **Detector Simulation** [![Papers-detector-simulation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#detector-simulation-)

## **Event Generation** [![Papers-event-generation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#event-generation-)
Event generators are programs that generate simulated events produced in collider experiments. In hadronic collisions, an event is composed of the following: \begin{enumerate} \item Incoming hadrons \item Hard part of the process \item Radiation \item Underlying event \item Hadronization \end{enumerate}

## **Jet Algorithms and Jet Tagging** [![Papers-jet-algorithms-and-jet-tagging](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#jet-algorithms-and-jet-tagging-)

## **Track Reconstruction** [![Papers-track-reconstruction](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#track-reconstruction-)
Given a set of signals, known as hits, from a detector's multiple layers of sensors, the goal is to cluster them into a collection of hits that come from the same particle. Each collision may produce a few thousand hits, making track reconstruction computationally demanding.
