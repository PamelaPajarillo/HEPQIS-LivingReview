## **Anomaly Detection** [![Papers-anomaly-detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#anomaly-detection-)
One of the main goals of high energy physics is to search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. The most common strategy in BSM searches is to pick a specific BSM signal model and estimate the background from Standard Model (SM) processes. The signal events are then combined with the background events to develop an analysis strategy to be appled on real data. This strategy is strongly model-dependent.

## **Beyond the Standard Model** [![Papers-beyond-the-standard-model](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#beyond-the-standard-model-)
The development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics was a collaborative effort among scientists around the world during the latter half of the 20th century. The SM explains the fundamental laws of nature that underlie the distinguishing properties of various elementary particles, as well as the three of the four known interactions between them, namely the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, which unite into the electroweak (EW), and the strong nuclear force. Its success lies not only in its capacity to provide an organizing principle for the subatomic world but also in its precise predictions regarding various physical processes that occur in this realm. Intriguingly, specific components of the SM were postulated before their eventual experimental validation, and the discovery of the Higgs Boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hardon Collider (LHC) at CERN in 2012 was the final missing piece of the SM, making it the most successful and precise scientific theory to date. \\\\ Despite its unprecedented explanatory and predictive power, the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics fails to explain several phenomena, necessitating the proposal of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. From the theoretical side, the SM cannot integrate Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, which explains gravity, the fourth fundamental interaction, in a mathematically consistent, united framework. On the phenomenological side, the SM cannot account for Dark Energy, which causes the accelerating expansion of the universe, or Dark Matter (DM), which constitutes about 85\% of the matter in the universe but remains non-observable due to its weakly interacting nature. The SM also lacks a mechanism to explain the observed abundance of matter over antimatter in the universe or the generation of non-vanishing, yet tiny, neutrino masses, the existence of which can be inferred by the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations. \\\\ To deal with these major puzzles, the theoretical physics community refines the existing high-precision SM calculations and proposes various BSM extensions. At the same time, experimental collaborations are pursuing the quest of hunting down any potential evidence towards deviations from the SM predictions. The new experiments include both high-energy direct searches for new particles at colliders as well as the low-energy frontier of high-precision measurements. Even though experiments may exhibit certain discrepancies, they are univocally accepted as New Physics (NP) signals only if they surpass a certain threshold of confidence level (CL), which in statistical language is defined as $5\sigma$ standard deviations above background expectations. Therefore, the discrepancies under question are reexamined carefully upon the collection of more data in order to avoid statistical flukes or experimental errors. \\\\ At present, the SM seems to be a rather too good description of nature at the energy scales that we have access to. It is possible that the energy scales associated with BSM physics are higher than those probed by current experiments, new experimental techniques and facilities are required. However, it is also possible that these scales within the reach of LHC (and other experiments), but the relevant NP signal is buried within the uncertainties of measurements and theory predictions. As a matter of fact, the extraction of this information is challenging in many motivated BSM scenarios. In that case, all the available data as well as the ones that will be collected during the high-luminosity phase (HL-LHC) phase must be scrutinized to full extent.

## **Event Generation** [![Papers-event-generation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#event-generation-)
Event generators are programs that generate simulated events produced in collider experiments. An event is the outcome of a collision between two incoming particles, or the outcome of an isolated decay of a particle, which consists of a number of outgoing particles. In high-energy hadronic collisions, the main components an event is composed of the following: \begin{enumerate} \item Incoming hadrons: The initial partons involved in a hard scattering process are selected using parton distribution functions for the incoming hadrons. \item Hard scattering: The kinematics of the outgoing  partons are based on matrix elements calculated in perturbation theory. \item Radiation: The incoming and outgoing partons radiate quarks and gluons. This radiation pattern can be approximated semi-classically using a parton shower algorithm. Parton showers link the perturbative and non-perturbative energy regimes. \item Underlying event: Scattering also occurs with other partons not associated with the hard scattering process coming from the incoming hadrons. These partons tend to be soft, i.e. lower energy than the partons from the hard scattering process. \item Hadronization: This refers the the formations of hadrons out of quarks and gluons. \end{enumerate} Common event generators include Pythia, Herwig, and Sherpa.

## **Track Reconstruction** [![Papers-track-reconstruction](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#track-reconstruction-)
Given a set of signals, known as hits, from a detector's multiple layers of sensors, the goal is to cluster them into a collection of hits that come from the same particle. Each collision may produce a few thousand hits, making track reconstruction computationally demanding.
