## **Jet Algorithms and Jet Tagging** [![Papers-jet-algorithms-and-jet-tagging](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#jet-algorithms-and-jet-tagging-)

## **Track Reconstruction** [![Papers-track-reconstruction](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link_to-Papers-AA96DA)](/BY_HEP/README.md#track-reconstruction-)
Given a set of signals, known as hits, from a detector's multiple layers of sensors, the goal is to cluster them into a collection of hits that come from the same particle. Each collision may produce a few thousand hits, making track reconstruction computationally demanding.
