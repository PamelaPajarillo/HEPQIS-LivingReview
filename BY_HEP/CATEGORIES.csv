Reviews,"The references below are (static) reviews in applications of quantum information science to particle physics."
Whitepapers,"The references below are whitepapers in applications of quantum information science to particle physics. Note that these references are from the Snowmass Community Planning Exercises."
Jet Algorithms and Jet Tagging,"To be written"
Track Reconstruction,"Given a set of signals, known as hits, from a detector's multiple layers of sensors, the goal is to cluster them into a collection of hits that come from the same particle. Each collision may produce a few thousand hits, making track reconstruction computationally demanding. "
