Jet Algorithms and Jet Tagging,"To be written"
Track Reconstruction,"Given a set of signals, known as hits, from a detector's multiple layers of sensors, the goal is to cluster them into a collection of hits that come from the same particle. Each collision may produce a few thousand hits, making track reconstruction computationally demanding. "
Event Generation,"Event generators are programs that generate simulated events produced in collider experiments. In hadronic collisions, an event is composed of the following: \begin{enumerate} \item Incoming hadrons \item Hard part of the process \item Radiation \item Underlying event \item Hadronization \end{enumerate}"
