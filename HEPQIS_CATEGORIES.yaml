    One of the main goals of high energy physics is to search for Beyond the
    Standard Model (BSM) physics. The most common strategy in BSM searches is to
    pick a specific BSM signal model and estimate the background from Standard
    Model (SM) processes. The signal events are then combined with the
    background events to develop an analysis strategy to be appled on real data.
    This strategy is strongly model-dependent.
- Category: Beyond the Standard Model
  Description: >-
    The development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics was a
    collaborative effort among scientists around the world during the latter
    half of the 20th century. The SM explains the fundamental laws of nature
    that underlie the distinguishing properties of various elementary particles,
    as well as the three of the four known interactions between them, namely the
    electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, which unite into the electroweak
    (EW), and the strong nuclear force. Its success lies not only in its
    capacity to provide an organizing principle for the subatomic world but also
    in its precise predictions regarding various physical processes that occur
    in this realm. Intriguingly, specific components of the SM were postulated
    before their eventual experimental validation, and the discovery of the
    Higgs Boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hardon Collider
    (LHC) at CERN in 2012 was the final missing piece of the SM, making it the
    most successful and precise scientific theory to date. \\\\ Despite its
    unprecedented explanatory and predictive power, the Standard Model (SM) of
    particle physics fails to explain several phenomena, necessitating the
    proposal of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. From the theoretical
    side, the SM cannot integrate Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, which
    explains gravity, the fourth fundamental interaction, in a mathematically
    consistent, united framework. On the phenomenological side, the SM cannot
    account for Dark Energy, which causes the accelerating expansion of the
    universe, or Dark Matter (DM), which constitutes about 85\% of the matter in
    the universe but remains non-observable due to its weakly interacting
    nature. The SM also lacks a mechanism to explain the observed abundance of
    matter over antimatter in the universe or the generation of non-vanishing,
    yet tiny, neutrino masses, the existence of which can be inferred by the
    phenomenon of neutrino oscillations. \\\\ To deal with these major puzzles,
    the theoretical physics community refines the existing high-precision SM
    calculations and proposes various BSM extensions. At the same time,
    experimental collaborations are pursuing the quest of hunting down any
    potential evidence towards deviations from the SM predictions. The new
    experiments include both high-energy direct searches for new particles at
    colliders as well as the low-energy frontier of high-precision measurements.
    Even though experiments may exhibit certain discrepancies, they are
    univocally accepted as New Physics (NP) signals only if they surpass a
    certain threshold of confidence level (CL), which in statistical language is
    defined as $5\sigma$ standard deviations above background expectations.
    Therefore, the discrepancies under question are reexamined carefully upon
    the collection of more data in order to avoid statistical flukes or
    experimental errors. \\\\ At present, the SM seems to be a rather too good
    description of nature at the energy scales that we have access to. It is
    possible that the energy scales associated with BSM physics are higher than
    those probed by current experiments, new experimental techniques and
    facilities are required. However, it is also possible that these scales
    within the reach of LHC (and other experiments), but the relevant NP signal
    is buried within the uncertainties of measurements and theory predictions.
    As a matter of fact, the extraction of this information is challenging in
    many motivated BSM scenarios. In that case, all the available data as well
    as the ones that will be collected during the high-luminosity phase (HL-LHC)
    phase must be scrutinized to full extent.

- Category: Continuous Variable Quantum Computing
  Description: >-
    Continuous variable quantum computing is a quantum computing paradigm that
    uses a large number of modes of the harmonic oscillator, which can be
    represented as $\ket{\psi} = \int \,dx\, \psi(x) \ket{x} $, whereas discrete
    variable quantum computing uses discrete number of quantum bits, for
    example, a qubit can be represented as $\ket{\psi} = c_0 \ket{0} + c_1
    \ket{1}$.
- Category: Quantum Algorithms Based on Amplitude Amplification
  Description: >-
    The quantum search algorithm, also known as Grover's algorithm, performs a
    generic search for a solution to a search problem, using a technique known
    as amplitude amplification, which increases the amplitude of the desired
    states. Assuming that the solutions of the search problem can be expressed
    as binary strings of length $n$, such that $N= 2^n$, where $N$ is the
    dimension of the search space, then any search problem can be represented as
    a function $f(x)$ where $$ f(x) = \begin{cases}1 & \text{if $x$ is a
    solution} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ Grover's algorithm aims to
    find an input $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ such that $f(x) = 1$. Suppose the function
    $f$ is implemented by an oracle, a black box that can recognize solutions to
    the search problem. Classically, it would take $\mathcal{O}(N)$ queries to
    the oracle to find the solution, however, using Grover's algorithm would
    allow this search to be sped up substatially, requiring only
    $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries. The quantum oracle can be represented by a
    unitary operator $U_f$, defined by $U_f : \ket{x} \ket{q} \rightarrow
    \ket{x} \ket{q \oplus f(x)}$, where $\ket{x}$ is the index register,
    $\ket{q}$ is the oracle register consisting of a single qubit which is
    flipped if $f(x) = 1$ and unchanged otherwise, and $\oplus$ is addition
    modulo 2. Let $\ket{q} = \ket{0}$, then given a query value $x$, prepare the
    state $\ket{x} \ket{0}$, apply oracle $U_f$, and measure the oracle qubit.
    If the oracle qubit has flipped to $ \ket{1}$, then $x$ is a solution to the
    search problem. If the oracle qubit is $\ket{q} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}
    - \ket{1})$, then the action of the oracle $U_f$ is $$U_f \; : \; \ket{x}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1}) \longmapsto (-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1}) $$ Note that the state of the oracle
    qubit $\ket{q} $ has not changed, in other words $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}
    - \ket{1})$ is an eigenstate, therefore, the oracle can be ignored, and the
    action of $U_f$ is given by $$U_f \; : \; \ket{x} \longmapsto (-1)^{f(x)}
    \ket{x}$$ Therefore, the oracle marks the solution to the search problem by
    a phase shift. Define an $n$-qubit phase shift operator $U_s$ with the
    following action, $ U_s \; : \; \ket{x} \mapsto (-1)^{\delta_{x_0}}
    \ket{x}$. $U_s$ applies a phase shift to all $n$-qubit states orthogonal to
    $\ket{00\ldots0}$. \\\\ The Grover's algorithm is as follows:
    \begin{enumerate} \item Start with the $n$-qubit state initialized in the
    state $\ket{00\ldots0}$ \item Apply the $n$-qubit Hadamard gate $H$ to
    prepare the state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \ket{\psi} = \sum_{x=0}^{N-1}\ket{x}$,
    where $N = 2^n$ \item Apply the following subroutine Grover iterate $G =
    HU_sHU_f$ a total of $\lfloor \frac{\pi}{4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\rfloor$ times
    \begin{enumerate} \item Apply the oracle $U_f$ \item Apply the $n$-qubit
    Hadamard gate $H$ \item Apply the phase shift operator $U_s$ \item Apply the
    $n$-qubit Hadamard gate \end{enumerate} \item Measure the resulting state
    \end{enumerate} Grover's search algorithm can be generalized to a process
    known as amplitude amplification.
- Category: Quantum Annealing
  Description: >-
    Quantum annealing is a quantum computing method used to solve optimization
    problems. It is currently the only quantum computing paradigm that enables
    architectures with large number of qubits, such as D-Wave Systems' Pegasus
    quantum processor chip with 5000 qubits. The classical counterpart,
    simulated annealing, mimics the process of heating up a material above its
    recrystallization temperature then cooled down slowly in order to change the
    material to a desirable structure. Simulated annealing is capable of finding
    global extrema as it is able to escape local extrema. The simulated
    annealing algorithm is as follows: (1) Start with an initial solution $s =
    s_0$ and an initial temperature $t = t_0$, Let $E(s)$ be the loss function
    of $s$; (2) Define a temperature reduction scheme. Some examples of
    temperature reduction schemes are: $t = t - \alpha$, $t = t\alpha$, and $t =
    \frac{t}{1+\alpha t}$; (3) Starting at $t = t_0$, consider some neighborhood
    of solution $N(s)$, and pick one of the solutions $s'$; (4) Calculate the
    difference of the loss function $\delta E$ between the solutions $s$ and
    $s'$. If $\delta E \geq 0$, accept the new solution. If $\delta < 0$,
    generate a uniform random number $r$ between 0 and 1. Accept the solution if
    $r < e^{\frac{\delta E}{t}}$. Note that for large $t$, the probability of
    selecting $s'$ is high; (5) Repeat steps (3) and (4) for $n$ iterations,
    updating $t$ given by the temperature reduction rule. \\\\ Quantum annealers
    solve very specific optimization problems called Quadratic Unconstrained
    Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The QUBO problem consists of finding a
    binary string that is minimal with respect to a quadratic polynomial over
    binary variables. The main challenge is to rephrase the loss function to a
    QUBO problem, which is equivalent to finding the ground state of a
    corresponding Ising model, whose Hamiltonian is given by $$H(\sigma) =
    \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}J_{ij} s_i s_j + \sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i s_i$$where $s_i \in
    \{-1, +1\}$ are the spin values, and $h_i$ and $J_{ij}$ are adjustable
    constants that represents biases and coupling strengths, respectively. The
    Hamiltonian of the quantum version of the Ising model, the transverse field
    Ising model, is given by $$ H_f = \sum_{i,j =
    1}^{n}J_{ij}\sigma_{i}^{z}\sigma_{j}^{z} + \sum_{i}^{n}h_i\sigma_{i}^{z}
    $$where $\sigma_{i}^{z}$ is the Pauli-$Z$ acting on qubit $i$. In quantum
    annealing, one initializes the system in the ground state of the initial
    Hamiltonian $H_i$, given by $$ H_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{i}^{x}
    $$corresponding to the state $(\ket{0} + \ket{1})^{\otimes n}$. The quantum
    adiabatic theorem states that if the transition between two Hamiltonians is
    gradual, the system will stay in the ground state. After initializing the
    system, it slowly evolves by changing the Hamiltonian given by $$ H(t) =
    \left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right)H_i + \frac{t}{T} H_f $$where $T$ is the total
    time in the annealing process. Measuring the final state after the anneal
    will give the solution to the QUBO problem, since the final system is in an
    eigenstate of $H_f$.

- Category: Quantum Walks
  Description: >-
    A random walk is a random process that describes a path that consists of a
    sequence of steps that are determined randomly. An example of a one
    dimensional discrete random walk is a random walk on the integer number line
    starting at $0$, and each step moves $+1$ or $-1$ with an equal probability,
    which is analogous to flipping a coin then, depending on the outcome, move
    forward or backwards on the number line. This can be described as a Markov
    chain, a sequence of random variables with the property that the probability
    of moving to the next step only depends on the current step and not the
    previous step, i.e. $p(X_{n+1} = x | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots) =
    p(X_{n+1} = x | X_n = x_n)$. This can be extended to higher dimensions. An
    example of a continuous random walk is Brownian motion, the random motion of
    particles in a medium. \\\\ The quantum discrete random walk defines the
    movement of a walker in position basis, $\mathcal{H}_P = \{ \ket{i} : i \in
    \mathbb{Z} \}$, controlled by the coin in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ basis,
    $\mathcal{H}_C = \{\ket{\uparrow}, \ket{\downarrow}\}$. The translation of
    the walker can be represented by the unitary operator $T = \sum \ket{i + 1}
    \bra{i} \otimes \ket{\uparrow} \bra{\uparrow} + \sum \ket{i-1} \bra{k}
    \otimes \ket{\downarrow} \bra{\downarrow} $, where the index $i$ runs over
    $\mathcal{Z}$. Therefore, $T \ket{i} \ket{\uparrow} = \ket{i + 1}
    \ket{\uparrow}$ and $T \ket{i} \ket{\downarrow} = \ket{i-1}
    \ket{\downarrow}$. A single step of the random walk is constructed from a
    coin flip unitary operation $C$ and the translation operator, $T$.
    Therefore, a single step can be represented as a unitary operator $U = T
    \cdot (C \otimes \mathbb{I})$. An $N$-step quantum walk is defined by $U^N$.
    In the quantum random walk, the coin register is not measured during each
    step. This introduces interference, which is drastically different from the
    classical random walk.
