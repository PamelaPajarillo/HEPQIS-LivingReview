    Anomaly detection, where the following BSM processes are considered
    anomalies: (1) narrow Randall-Sundrum gravitons decaying to two $W$-bosons
    (Narrow $G \rightarrow WW$); (2) broad Randall-Sundrum graviton decaying to
    two $W$-bosons (Broad $G \rightarrow WW$); (3) scalar bosons $A$ decaying to
    a Higgs and a $Z$ boson ($A \rightarrow HZ$)
  QIS_Methods: >-
    (1) Used a convolutional autoencoder model to map events into a latent
    representation of reduced dimensionality; (2) A Quantum Support Vector
    Machine (QSVM), the Quantum K-means (QK-means) algorithm, and the Quantum
    K-medians algorithm, are trained to find anomalous events in the latent
    representation, as well as their respective classical counterparts
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    With a training sample of size 600 and a fixed latent dimensionality $l =
    8$, all classical and quantum ML methods performed worst on the broad
    Graviton and best with the narrow Graviton, which is expected since the
    broad Graviton is the most similar to SM processes, making it harder to
    identify, while the narrow Graviton is the least similar to SM processes,
    making it easier to identify. The unsupervised kernel machine outperforms
    both clustering algorithms and is the only model where the quantum
    classifier outperforms the classical counterpart. If entanglement is not
    present in the quantum feature map, the performance of the QSVM is worse or
    matches the performance of the CSVM. This paper demonstrates a consistent
    performance advantage of quantum models over classical models for an anomaly
    detection task, where a combination of an autoencoder with quantum anomaly
    detection models proved to be a viable strategy for data-driven searches for
    new physics.

    Anomaly detection, where the background is Standard Model (SM) events, and
    the anomaly is either the Higgs boson or the Randall-Sundrum Graviton
    decaying to two $Z$ bosons, where each of the $Z$ bosons decay to a lepton
    pair
  QIS_Methods: >-
    Applied Classical and Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (CSVCs and QSVCs 
    respectively) trained to identify the artificial anomalies to distinguish 
    between SM and BSM events. A dataset of artificial events that do not rely 
    on a specific BSM theory is generated by using SM events and varying the 
    different features by dataset scrambling, which is done by replacing a feature 
    with a new value chosen according to a Gaussian distribution and a scrambling 
    factor
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    An SVC trained to identify artificial anomalies was able to identify BSM
    events with high accuracy. In identifying artificial anomalies, the CSVC
    outperforms the QSVC, however, the difference in performance between the
    QSVC and the CSVC shrinks for increasing number of features and increasing
    scrambling strength. In identifying Higgs and Graviton events, the QSVC
    performs better than the CSVC with a low scrambling factor. When the
    scrambling factor increases, the performance gap shrinks when detecting
    Graviton events, and the CSVC outperforms the QSVC when detecting the Higgs.
    The paper concludes that while there is no advantage of using a quantum
    classifier, the limitations in performance could be due to using classical
    features that describe quantum HEP processes.

    Two implementations of parameterized quantum circuits where the rotation

  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    A common theme from analyzing the performance of Quantum Machine Learning
    (QML) in High Energy Physics (HEP) is QML seems to outperform Classical
    Machine Learning (CML) with small training datasets. However, there are
    almost no problems in HEP with small number of events in training. This
    paper considers a realistic example, the four lepton final state, where the
    training set is limited by low statistics. After comparing VQC and QCL to
    CML algorithms, this paper states that there is no evidence that QML
    provides any advantage to CML in collider physics, and QML appears to be
    systematically worse.

  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    The performance of these quantum simulators, using 15 qubits and 60
    independent datasets of 20000 training events and 20000 testing events, are
    similar to the performance of a classical SVM and a classical BDT. The
    QSVM-Kernel algorithm is then implemented on IBM's quantum processor. The
    mean performance of QSVM-Kernel on IBM's quantum processor and IBM's quantum
    computer simulator is about 5\% lower. This difference is expected due to
    hardware noise. The results on IBM's quantum processor does approach the
    performance of IBM's quantum computer simulator. The paper concludes that
    the running time is expected to be reduced with improved quantum hardware
    and predicts that quantum machine learning could potentially become a
    powerful tool for HEP data analyses.

  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    This paper reviews two paradigms of quantum machine learning: quantum
    annealing and quantum circuit model. The paper discusses three papers using
    quantum annealing (1-3) and three papers using quantum circuits (4-6): (1)
    \textit{Solving a Higgs Optimization Problem with Quantum Annealing for
    Machine Learning}; (2) \textit{Quantum Adiabatic Machine Learning with
    Zooming}; (3) \textit{Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Galaxy Morphology
    Classification with a Quantum Annealer}; (4) \textit{Particle Track
    Reconstruction with Quantum Algorithms}; (5) \textit{Application of Quantum
    Machine Learning to High Energy Physics Analysis at LHC Using IBM Quantum
    Computer Simulators and IBM Quantum Computer Hardware}; (6) \textit{Event
    Classification with Quantum Machine Learning in High-Energy Physics}. The
    main themes throughout these papers is that there is no significant
    performance advantage between quantum and classical machine learning,
    however, QML has a slight advantage for smaller datasets. The paper
    discusses the challenges, such as the difficulty to map the problem onto a
    quantum annealer device with limited connectivity and the hardware
    limitations to perform quantum circuit-based machine learning, and outlooks,
    such as performing quantum machine learning directly on quantum objects and
    quantum simulations.

    Signal-background discrimination, where the signal is a SUSY process, in
    particular, a chargino-pair production via a Higgs boson, where the final
    state has two charged leptons and missing transverse momentum. The
    background event is a $W$ boson pair production $WW$ where each $W$ decays
    into a charged lepton and a neutrino.
  QIS_Methods: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) and Quantum Circuit Learning (QCL)
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    The performance of the QCL algorithms on quantum simulators is characterized
    by a relatively flat AUC as a function of the number of training events. The
    AUC for QCL is higher than the AUC for BDT and DNN for a low number of
    training events, however, for high training events, the performance for BDT
    and DNN surpasses QCL. The VQC algorithm has been tested on IBM's quantum
    computer, and the performance is similar to that of the quantum simulator.
    However, there is an increase in uncertainty due to hardware noise. Other
    QCL and VQC models are tested, which do not show any improvement to the
    nominal QCL and VQC models. The behavior that variational quantum algorithms
    does better with a small number of training data could be considered as a
    possible advantage over classical machine learning.

    Thrust, an event shape whose optimum corresponds to the most jet-like
    separating plane among a set of particles, focusing on the case of
    electron-positron collisions
  QIS_Methods: >-
    (1) Created a quantum algorithm based on quantum annealing (encoded
    optimization problem as a QUBO problem); (2) Created quantum algorithm based
    on Grover search and describes two computing models, sequential model and
    parallel model, for loading classical data into quantum memory.
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    This paper finds an algorithm that improves the previously best known
    $O(N^3)$ classical thrust algorithm to an $O(N^2)$ sequential algorithm,
    while also finding an improved $O(N^2 \log N)$ classical algorithm. The
    computational costs of data loading must be carefully considered when
    evaluating the potential for quantum speedups on classical datasets.

    By iteratively perform quantum annealing, the binary weights on the weak
    classifiers can be made continuous, which results in a stronger classifier.
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    QAML-Z does not show an obvious advantage over traditional machine learning
    methods, including deep neural networks (DNNs) and boosted decision trees
    (BDTs), however, its performance surpasses the QAML algorithm and simulated
    annealing with zooming.

    diphoton processes corresponds to either to a Higgs boson decay (signal) or

  QIS_Methods: >-
    The strong classifier is constructed from a linear combination of weak
    classifiers, where the weights are obtained through an optimization problem,
    which have a mapping to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
    problem. D-Wave's quantum annealer is used to solve the QUBO problem.
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    Quantum and classical annealing-based classifiers perform comparably with no
    clear advantage to traditional machine learning methods, including deep
    neural network (DNN) and an ensemble of boosted decision trees (BDTs).
