    Particle track reconstruction by reconstruction trajectories from smaller
    track segments. Two hits from different layers form a doublet, then two
    doublets are combined to triplets. The algorithm identifies true triplets by
    comparing the quality of each triplets by looking at triplets that overlap
    by two hits.
  QIS_Methods: >-
    (1) Formulate the track reconstruction problem as a quadratic unconstrained
    binary optimization (QUBO) problem, where the problem is minimizing the cost
    function; (2) Divide the full QUBO insto smaller sub-QUBOs in order to fit
    on NISQ computers; (3) Used a Layer Variational Quantum Eigensolver (L-VQE)
    to find the minimum of the cost function; (4) Modified the cost function to
    conditional value at risk (CVaR)
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    To determine the impact of dividing the full QUBO into sub-QUBOs, the 
    efficiency and purity is computed for various sub-QUBO sizes. Assuming the
    VQE finds the ground state of every sub-QUBO and that the quantum computer
    is noise-free, the efficiency for sub-QUBO size 16 reaches 0.7 for a density
    of 1000 particles per event, and drops rapidly as the density increases. For
    a sub-QUBO of size 128, the efficiency is above 0.9 for densities below 5000
    particles per event, which is comparable to solving the full QUBO. The
    purity for all sizes of sub-QUBOs at all densities is above 0.8. However,
    adding noise to the quantum computer significantly worsens the result. Using
    CVaR as the cost function does improve the performance. This paper
    demonstrates that sub-QUBO sizes compatible with NISQ computers yield
    reasonable efficiency and purity.

    Anomaly detection, where the following BSM processes are considered
    anomalies: (1) narrow Randall-Sundrum gravitons decaying to two $W$-bosons
    (Narrow $G \rightarrow WW$); (2) broad Randall-Sundrum graviton decaying to
    two $W$-bosons (Broad $G \rightarrow WW$); (3) scalar bosons $A$ decaying to
    a Higgs and a $Z$ boson ($A \rightarrow HZ$)
  QIS_Methods: >-
    (1) Used a convolutional autoencoder model to map events into a latent
    representation of reduced dimensionality; (2) A Quantum Support Vector
    Machine (QSVM), the Quantum K-means (QK-means) algorithm, and the Quantum
    K-medians algorithm, are trained to find anomalous events in the latent
    representation, as well as their respective classical counterparts
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    All classical and quantum ML methods performed worst on the broad Graviton
    and best with the narrow Graviton, which is expected since the broad
    Graviton is the most similar to SM processes, making it harder to identify,
    while the narrow Graviton is the least similar to SM processes, making it
    easier to identify. The unsupervised kernel machine outperforms both
    clustering algorithms and is the only model where the quantum classifier
    outperforms the classical counterpart. If entanglement is not present in the
    quantum feature map, the performance of the QSVM is worse or matches the
    performance of the CSVM. This paper demonstrates a consistent performance
    advantage of quantum models over classical models for an anomaly detection
    task, where a combination of an autoencoder with quantum anomaly detection
    models proved to be a viable strategy for data-driven searches for new
    physics.

    Anomaly detection, where the background is Standard Model (SM) events, and
    the anomaly is either the Higgs boson or the Randall-Sundrum Graviton
    decaying to two $Z$ bosons, where each of the $Z$ bosons decay to a lepton
    pair
  QIS_Methods: >-
    Applied Classical and Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (CSVCs and QSVCs 
    respectively) trained to identify the artificial anomalies to distinguish 
    between SM and BSM events. A dataset of artificial events that do not rely 
    on a specific BSM theory is generated by using SM events and varying the 
    different features by dataset scrambling, which is done by replacing a
    feature with a new value chosen according to a Gaussian distribution and a
    scrambling factor.
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    An SVC trained to identify artificial anomalies was able to identify BSM
    events with high accuracy. In identifying artificial anomalies, the CSVC
    outperforms the QSVC, however, the difference in performance between the
    QSVC and the CSVC shrinks for increasing number of features and increasing
    scrambling strength. In identifying Higgs and Graviton events, the QSVC
    performs better than the CSVC with a low scrambling factor. When the
    scrambling factor increases, the performance gap shrinks when detecting
    Graviton events, and the CSVC outperforms the QSVC when detecting the Higgs.
    The paper concludes that while there is no advantage of using a quantum
    classifier, the limitations in performance could be due to using classical
    features that describe quantum HEP processes.

    Two parameterized quantum circuits implemented in Pennylane: (1) Variational
    Quantum Circuits (VQC) and (2) Quantum Circuit Learning (QCL). These
    implementations are compared to two neural networks implemented in
    TensorFlow. 
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    A common theme from analyzing the performance of Quantum Machine Learning
    (QML) in collider physics is that QML seems to outperform Classical Machine
    Learning (CML) with small training datasets. However, there are almost no
    problems in collider physics with small number of events for training. This
    paper considers a realistic example where the final state is not modeled
    precisely enough for the data versus simulation strategy to be effective at
    finding small signals. After comparing VQC and QCL to CML, this paper states
    that there is no evidence that QML provides any advantage over CML in
    collider physics, and the performance of QML appears to be systematically
    worse.

  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    This whitepaper summarizes the status and prospects of quantum computing for
    track reconstruction, jet clustering, HEP classification tasks, and data
    generation. For track reconstruction and jet clustering tasks, quantum
    computing is limited by the size and connectivity of available devices,
    therefore, it remains unclear whether quantum computing can yield an
    advantage. For classification tasks, some quantum computing architectures
    and applications have shown promising results. For data generation, quantum
    generative models are expected to exhibit an advantage over classical
    generative models in runtime and the number of parameters needed to learn
    data distributions. In quantum annealing-based approaches, the main
    challenges are mapping the problem to the QUBO formulation, and embedding
    the problem onto a quantum annealer device with limited connectivity. The
    main challenges in gate-based approaches is the inefficiency of embedding
    classicaly data into quantum registers and the noise on current quantum
    devices.

    (1) Used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to compress the kinematic

    kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel). The quantum kernel entry for a pair of data
    events is given by the inner product of the quantum states, which is used to
    find the separating hyperplane; (3) Performed simulations on IBM, Google
    TensorFlow, and Amazon Braket quantum frameworks and compared it three
    classical kernels: linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels; (4) Analyzed the
    performance of the QSVM-Kernel on IBM's quantum processor 
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    The performance of these quantum simulators, using 15 qubits and 60
    independent datasets of 20000 training events and 20000 testing events, are
    similar to the performance of a classical SVM and a classical BDT. The mean
    performance of QSVM-Kernel on IBM's quantum processor and IBM's quantum
    computer simulator is about 5\% lower, which is expected due to hardware
    noise. The results on IBM's quantum processor does approach the performance
    of IBM's quantum computer simulator. The paper concludes that the running
    time is expected to be reduced with improved quantum hardware and predicts
    that quantum machine learning could potentially become a powerful tool for
    HEP data analyses.

    (1) Constructed graph adjacency matrices representing events, where the

    classical method called Laplacian Eigenvalues and a quantum method using
    Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) (3) Used K-means and Q-means clustering
    methods  with discrete qubit quantum computing to classify between signal
    and background
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    Using the K-means algorithm, there is an advantage in creating samples using
    GBS over Laplacian Eigenvalues, where the AUC of GBS is 0.79 and the AUC of
    Laplacian Eigenvalues is 0.74. The Q-means and the K-means results are
    equivalent using the classical and quantum embedding methods. Although this
    paper uses the Q-means algorithm on a discrete qubit quantum computer, it
    could be performed on a continuous variable quantum computer. This paper
    concludes that due to the speed of the sampling algorithm on near-term
    photonic devices, GBS may be feasible for trigger level anomaly detection
    for future LHC runs.

    (1) Encoded the input data of $N$ classical variables into a quantum state
    of an $N$-qubit system; (2) Trained a quantum variational circuit
    parameterized by gate angles; (3) Performed analysis on IBM quantum
    simulator and quantum hardware with 10 qubits
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    With 100 training events, 100 test events, and 10 encoded variables, the AUC
    of IBM's quantum computer simulator that includes a noise model with 10
    qubits are similar to the AUC of a classical support vector machine (SVM)
    and a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier. The results show that IBM's
    quantum computer and quantum simulator are in good agreement, however, the
    run time on the quantum computer is longer than the classical machine
    learning algorithms due to the limitations in quantum hardware. These
    results demonstrate the feasibility of using quantum machine learning on
    today's quantum computers to distinguish between signal and background in a
    realistic analysis at the LHC.

    machines, quantum graph networks, and variational quantum circuits
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    This paper reviews two paradigms of quantum machine learning: quantum
    annealing and quantum circuit model. The main themes throughout these papers
    discussed in the review is that there is no significant performance
    advantage between quantum and classical machine learning, however, QML has a
    slight advantage for smaller datasets. The paper discusses the challenges,
    such as the difficulty to map the problem onto a quantum annealer device
    with limited connectivity and the hardware limitations to perform quantum
    circuit-based machine learning, and outlooks, such as performing quantum
    machine learning directly on quantum objects and quantum simulations.

    Signal-background discrimination, where the signal is a SUSY process, in
    particular, a chargino-pair production via a Higgs boson, where the final
    state has two charged leptons and missing transverse momentum. The
    background event is a $W$ boson pair production $WW$ where each $W$ decays
    into a charged lepton and a neutrino.

    Analyzed two variational quantum algorithms where the rotation angles are
    optimized using classical methods: (1) Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)
    and (2) Quantum Circuit Learning (QCL). The VQC was implemented on IBM's
    QASM simulator and IBM's 20-qubit quantum computer. The QCL was implemented
    on Qulacs simulator. These variational quantum algorithms are compared to a
    Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). 
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    The performance of the QCL algorithms on quantum simulators is characterized
    by a relatively flat AUC as a function of the number of training events. The
    AUC for QCL is higher than the AUC for BDT and DNN for a low number of
    training events, however, for high training events, the performance for BDT
    and DNN surpasses QCL. The VQC algorithm has been tested on IBM's quantum
    computer, and the performance is similar to that of the quantum simulator.
    However, there is an increase in uncertainty due to hardware noise. Other
    QCL and VQC models are tested, which do not show any improvement to the
    nominal QCL and VQC models. The behavior that variational quantum algorithms
    does better with a small number of training data could be considered as a
    possible advantage over classical machine learning.

    The binary linear combination of weak classifiers in \textit{Solving a Higgs
    optimization problem with quantum annealing for machine learning}, is
    extended to a continuous linear combination of weak classifiers, which is
    done by iteratively performing quantum annealing, effectively zooming in on
    a region of the energy surface after each iteration. This algorithm is
    denoted by QAML-Z. The performance of QAML-Z is compared to simulated
    annealing with zooming (SA-Z) and simulated annealing with excited states
    and zooming (SAE-Z). The annealing methods are compared to a Deep Neural
    Network (DNN), Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), and logistic regression (LR-Z).
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    QAML-Z performs better than SA-Z on all training data set sizes and performs
    similarly to SAE-Z. QAML-Z does not show an obvious advantage over DNNs and
    BDTs, however, its performance surpasses QAML. Although QAML-Z does not show
    an advantage over DNN for large datasets, the performance gap between QAML
    and DNN is reduced by a factor of two. The paper concludes that the
    improvement of QAML-Z over QAML suggests that NISQ devices could be ready
    for machine learning applications in the near future.

    (1) Constructed weak classifiers from kinematic variables describing
    diphoton final state processes; (2) Created a strong classifier from the set
    of weak classifiers; (3) Optimized the weights of the weak classifiers with
    a QUBO problem; (4) Solved the QUBO problem with simulated annealing (SA)
    and quantum annealing (QAML). The optimization problem is solved with
    D-Wave's quantum annealer and simulated annealing. The performance of of the
    strong classifier is compared to a deep neural network (DNN) and boosted
    decision trees (BDT).
  Results_and_Conclusions: >-
    QAML could not find the true minimum of the cost function, due to noise in
    the quantum annealing hardware. SA accurately finds the same ground state
    found by quantum annealing, however, simulated annealing cannot reproduce
    the excited states found with quantum annealing. The quantum annealing
    classifier is resistant to overfitting. The performance of SA and QAML are
    comparable, however, there is no clear advantage of annealing-based
    classifiers over DNNs and BDTs. There is a slight advantage of QAML over SA
    for a small training dataset.
