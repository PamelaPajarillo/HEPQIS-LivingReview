Quantum Annealing,"Quantum annealing is a quantum computing method used to solve optimization problems. It is currently the only quantum computing paradigm that enables architectures with large number of qubits, such as D-Wave Systems' Pegasus quantum processor chip with 5000 qubits. The classical counterpart, simulated annealing, mimics the process of heating up a material above its recrystallization temperature then cooled down slowly in order to change the material to a desirable structure. Simulated annealing is capable of finding global extrema as it is able to escape local extrema. The simulated annealing algorithm is as follows: (1) Start with an initial solution $s = s_0$ and an initial temperature $t = t_0$, Let $E(s)$ be the loss function of $s$; (2) Define a temperature reduction scheme. Some examples of temperature reduction schemes are: $t = t - \alpha$, $t = t\alpha$, and $t = \frac{t}{1+\alpha t}$; (3) Starting at $t = t_0$, consider some neighborhood of solution $N(s)$, and pick one of the solutions $s'$; (4) Calculate the difference of the loss function $\delta E$ between the solutions $s$ and $s'$. If $\delta E \geq 0$, accept the new solution. If $\delta < 0$, generate a uniform random number $r$ between 0 and 1. Accept the solution if $r < e^{\frac{\delta E}{t}}$. Note that for large $t$, the probability of selecting $s'$ is high; (5) Repeat steps (3) and (4) for $n$ iterations, updating $t$ given by the temperature reduction rule. \\\\ Quantum annealers solve very specific optimization problems called Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The QUBO problem consists of finding a binary string that is minimal with respect to a quadratic polynomial over binary variables. The main challenge is to rephrase the loss function to a QUBO problem, which is equivalent to finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising model, whose Hamiltonian is given by $$H(\sigma) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}J_{ij} s_i s_j + \sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i s_i$$where $s_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ are the spin values, and $h_i$ and $J_{ij}$ are adjustable constants that represents biases and coupling strengths, respectively. The Hamiltonian of the quantum version of the Ising model, the transverse field Ising model, is given by $$ H_f = \sum_{i,j = 1}^{n}J_{ij}\sigma_{i}^{z}\sigma_{j}^{z} + \sum_{i}^{n}h_i\sigma_{i}^{z} $$where $\sigma_{i}^{z}$ is the Pauli-$Z$ acting on qubit $i$. In quantum annealing, one initializes the system in the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian $H_i$, given by $$ H_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{i}^{x} $$corresponding to the state $(| 0 \rangle + | 1 \rangle)^{\otimes n}$. The quantum adiabatic theorem states that if the transition between two Hamiltonians is gradual, the system will stay in the ground state. After initializing the system, it slowly evolves by changing the Hamiltonian given by $$ H(t) = \left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right)H_i + \frac{t}{T} H_f $$where $T$ is the total time in the annealing process. Measuring the final state after the anneal will give the solution to the QUBO problem, since the final system is in an eigenstate of $H_f$. This section reviews papers that involve quantum annealing approaches in particle physics."

Algorithms Based on Amplitude Amplification,"Amplitude amplification is a quantum algorithm which is a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. Grover's search algorithm is a quantum algorithm that solves the problem of finding a desired element in an unstructured list of $N$ elements in roughly $\sqrt{N}$ steps."
Quantum Walks,"A random walk is a random process that describes a path that consists of a sequence of steps that are determined randomly. An example of a one dimensional discrete random walk is a random walk on the integer number line starting at $0$, and each step moves $+1$ or $-1$ with an equal probability, which analogous to flipping a coin then, depending on the outcome, move forward or backwards on the number line. This can be described as a Markov chain, a sequence of random variables with the property that the probability of moving to the next step only depends on the current step and not the previous step, i.e. $p(X_{n+1} = x | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots) = p(X_{n+1} = x | X_n = x_n)$. This can be extended to higher dimensions. An example of a continuous random walk is Brownian motion, the random motion of particles in a medium. \\\\ The quantum discrete random walk defines the movement of a walker in position basis, $\mathcal{H}_P = \{ |i \rangle : i \in \mathbb{Z} \}$, controlled by the coin in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ basis, $\mathcal{H}_C = \{| \uparrow \rangle, | \downarrow \rangle\}$. The translation of the walker can be represented by the unitary operator $T = \sum | i + 1 \rangle \langle i | \otimes | \uparrow \rangle \langle \uparrow | + \sum | i -1 \rangle \langle i | \otimes | \downarrow \rangle \langle \downarrow | $, where the index $i$ runs over $\mathcal{Z}$. Therefore, 
$T |i \rangle | \uparrow \rangle = | i + 1 \rangle | \uparrow \rangle$ and $T |i \rangle | \downarrow \rangle = | i - 1 \rangle | \downarrow \rangle$. A single step of the random walk is constructed from a coin flip unitary operation $C$ and the translation operator, $T$. Therefore, a single step can be represented as a unitary operator $U = T \cdot (C \otimes \mathbb{I})$. An $N$-step quantum walk is defined by $U^N$. In the quantum random walk, the coin register is not measured during each step. This introduces interference, which is drastically different from the classical random walk."
Continuous Variable Quantum Computing,"Continuous variable quantum computing is a quantum computing paradigm that uses a large number of modes of the harmonic oscillator, which can be represented as $| \psi \rangle = \int \,dx\, \psi(x) | x \rangle $, whereas discrete variable quantum computing uses discrete number of quantum bits, for example, a qubit can be represented as $\psi \rangle = c_0 | 0 \rangle + c_1 | 1 \rangle$."
