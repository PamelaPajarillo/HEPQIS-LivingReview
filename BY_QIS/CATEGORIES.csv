Continuous Variable Quantum Computing,"Continuous variable quantum computing is a quantum computing paradigm that uses a large number of modes of the harmonic oscillator, which can be represented as $\ket{\psi} = \int \,dx\, \psi(x) \ket{x} $, whereas discrete variable quantum computing uses discrete number of quantum bits, for example, a qubit can be represented as $\ket{\psi} = c_0 \ket{0} + c_1 \ket{1}$."
Quantum Algorithms Based on Amplitude Amplification,"The quantum search algorithm, also known as Grover's algorithm, performs a generic search for a solution to a search problem, using a technique known as amplitude amplification, which increases the amplitude of the desired states. Assuming that the solutions of the search problem can be expressed as binary strings of length $n$, such that $N= 2^n$, where $N$ is the dimension of the search space, then any search problem can be represented as a function $f(x)$ where $$ f(x) = \begin{cases}1 & \text{if $x$ is a solution} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ Grover's algorithm aims to find an input $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ such that $f(x) = 1$. Suppose the function $f$ is implemented by an oracle, a black box that can recognize solutions to the search problem. Classically, it would take $\mathcal{O}(N)$ queries to the oracle to find the solution, however, using Grover's algorithm would allow this search to be sped up substatially, requiring only $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries. The quantum oracle can be represented by a unitary operator $U_f$, defined by $U_f : \ket{x} \ket{q} \rightarrow \ket{x} \ket{q \oplus f(x)}$, where $\ket{x}$ is the index register, $\ket{q}$ is the oracle register consisting of a single qubit which is flipped if $f(x) = 1$ and unchanged otherwise, and $\oplus$ is addition modulo 2. Let $\ket{q} = \ket{0}$, then given a query value $x$, prepare the state $\ket{x} \ket{0}$, apply oracle $U_f$, and measure the oracle qubit. If the oracle qubit has flipped to $ \ket{1}$, then $x$ is a solution to the search problem. If the oracle qubit is $\ket{q} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1})$, then the action of the oracle $U_f$ is $$U_f \; : \; \ket{x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1}) \longmapsto (-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1}) $$ Note that the state of the oracle qubit $\ket{q} $ has not changed, in other words $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1})$ is an eigenstate, therefore, the oracle can be ignored, and the action of $U_f$ is given by $$U_f \; : \; \ket{x} \longmapsto (-1)^{f(x)} \ket{x}$$ Therefore, the oracle marks the solution to the search problem by a phase shift. Define an $n$-qubit phase shift operator $U_s$ with the following action, $ U_s \; : \; \ket{x} \mapsto (-1)^{\delta_{x0}} \ket{x}$. $U_s$ applies a phase shift to all $n$-qubit states orthogonal to $\ket{00\ldots0}$. \\\\ The Grover's algorithm is as follows: \begin{enumerate} \item Start with the $n$-qubit state initialized in the state $\ket{00\ldots0}$ \item Apply the $n$-qubit Hadamard gate $H$ to prepare the state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \ket{\psi} = \sum_{x=0}^{N-1}\ket{x}$, where $N = 2^n$ \item Apply the following subroutine Grover iterate $G = HU_sHU_f$ a total of $\lfloor \frac{\pi}{4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\rfloor$ times \begin{enumerate} \item Apply the oracle $U_f$ \item Apply the $n$-qubit Hadamard gate $H$ \item Apply the phase shift operator $U_s$ \item Apply the $n$-qubit Hadamard gate \end{enumerate} \item Measure the resulting state \end{enumerate} Grover's search algorithm can be generalized to a process known as amplitude amplification.

Quantum Annealing,"Quantum annealing is a quantum computing method used to solve optimization problems. It is currently the only quantum computing paradigm that enables architectures with large number of qubits, such as D-Wave Systems' Pegasus quantum processor chip with 5000 qubits. The classical counterpart, simulated annealing, mimics the process of heating up a material above its recrystallization temperature then cooled down slowly in order to change the material to a desirable structure. Simulated annealing is capable of finding global extrema as it is able to escape local extrema. The simulated annealing algorithm is as follows: (1) Start with an initial solution $s = s_0$ and an initial temperature $t = t_0$, Let $E(s)$ be the loss function of $s$; (2) Define a temperature reduction scheme. Some examples of temperature reduction schemes are: $t = t - \alpha$, $t = t\alpha$, and $t = \frac{t}{1+\alpha t}$; (3) Starting at $t = t_0$, consider some neighborhood of solution $N(s)$, and pick one of the solutions $s'$; (4) Calculate the difference of the loss function $\delta E$ between the solutions $s$ and $s'$. If $\delta E \geq 0$, accept the new solution. If $\delta < 0$, generate a uniform random number $r$ between 0 and 1. Accept the solution if $r < e^{\frac{\delta E}{t}}$. Note that for large $t$, the probability of selecting $s'$ is high; (5) Repeat steps (3) and (4) for $n$ iterations, updating $t$ given by the temperature reduction rule. \\\\ Quantum annealers solve very specific optimization problems called Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The QUBO problem consists of finding a binary string that is minimal with respect to a quadratic polynomial over binary variables. The main challenge is to rephrase the loss function to a QUBO problem, which is equivalent to finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising model, whose Hamiltonian is given by $$H(\sigma) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}J_{ij} s_i s_j + \sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i s_i$$where $s_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ are the spin values, and $h_i$ and $J_{ij}$ are adjustable constants that represents biases and coupling strengths, respectively. The Hamiltonian of the quantum version of the Ising model, the transverse field Ising model, is given by $$ H_f = \sum_{i,j = 1}^{n}J_{ij}\sigma_{i}^{z}\sigma_{j}^{z} + \sum_{i}^{n}h_i\sigma_{i}^{z} $$where $\sigma_{i}^{z}$ is the Pauli-$Z$ acting on qubit $i$. In quantum annealing, one initializes the system in the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian $H_i$, given by $$ H_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{i}^{x} $$corresponding to the state $(\ket{0} + \ket{1})^{\otimes n}$. The quantum adiabatic theorem states that if the transition between two Hamiltonians is gradual, the system will stay in the ground state. After initializing the system, it slowly evolves by changing the Hamiltonian given by $$ H(t) = \left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right)H_i + \frac{t}{T} H_f $$where $T$ is the total time in the annealing process. Measuring the final state after the anneal will give the solution to the QUBO problem, since the final system is in an eigenstate of $H_f$."

Quantum Walks,"A random walk is a random process that describes a path that consists of a sequence of steps that are determined randomly. An example of a one dimensional discrete random walk is a random walk on the integer number line starting at $0$, and each step moves $+1$ or $-1$ with an equal probability, which is analogous to flipping a coin then, depending on the outcome, move forward or backwards on the number line. This can be described as a Markov chain, a sequence of random variables with the property that the probability of moving to the next step only depends on the current step and not the previous step, i.e. $p(X_{n+1} = x | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots) = p(X_{n+1} = x | X_n = x_n)$. This can be extended to higher dimensions. An example of a continuous random walk is Brownian motion, the random motion of particles in a medium. \\\\ The quantum discrete random walk defines the movement of a walker in position basis, $\mathcal{H}_P = \{ \ket{i} : i \in \mathbb{Z} \}$, controlled by the coin in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ basis, $\mathcal{H}_C = \{\ket{\uparrow}, \ket{\downarrow}\}$. The translation of the walker can be represented by the unitary operator $T = \sum \ket{i + 1} \bra{i} \otimes \ket{\uparrow} \bra{\uparrow} + \sum \ket{i-1} \bra{k} \otimes \ket{\downarrow} \bra{\downarrow} $, where the index $i$ runs over $\mathcal{Z}$. Therefore, $T \ket{i} \ket{\uparrow} = \ket{i + 1} \ket{\uparrow}$ and $T \ket{i} \ket{\downarrow} = \ket{i-1} \ket{\downarrow}$. A single step of the random walk is constructed from a coin flip unitary operation $C$ and the translation operator, $T$. Therefore, a single step can be represented as a unitary operator $U = T \cdot (C \otimes \mathbb{I})$. An $N$-step quantum walk is defined by $U^N$. In the quantum random walk, the coin register is not measured during each step. This introduces interference, which is drastically different from the classical random walk."
