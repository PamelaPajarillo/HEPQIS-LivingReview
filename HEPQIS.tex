\abstract{Inspired by ``A Living Review of Machine Learning for Particle Physics"\footnote[1]{See \href{https://github.com/iml-wg/HEPML-LivingReview}{https://github.com/iml-wg/HEPML-LivingReview}.}, the goal of this document is to provide a nearly comprehensive list of citations for those developing and applying quantum information approaches to experimental, phenomenological, or theoretical analyses. Applications of quantum information science to high energy physics is a relatively new field of research. As a living document, it will be updated as often as possible with the relevant literature with the latest developments.  Suggestions are most welcome.}
